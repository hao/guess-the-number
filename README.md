# Guess The Number

At Vistar, we like to play "Guess the Number" in our downtime. One of the
engineers hacked together our prior version using raw jQuery. We're
trying to modernize with some new technology.

Some improvements in this new version:

* jQuery replaced with ReactJS and Flux
* Code and markup separated with React-Template
* UI broken up into modular components
* Unit tests with Jest
* Bootstrap styling

## Notes

To build and run this:

```
npm install && npm start
```
